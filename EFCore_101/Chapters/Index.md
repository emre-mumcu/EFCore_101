## Hello everyone;

---

My name is Emre and I am a software development enthusiast. I first met a computer in 1993 in the second year of high school. The `GW-BASIC` course I took in the computer lab that year was a turning point in my life. I have been coding since then. 

I spend most of my time researching new technologies, analyzing, designing and coding.

The reason why I created this tutorial is to note down the solutions of the problems I encountered over time, to record them in an easily accessible way in the future and to present them in an easily accessible way for those who need information like me.
